# KINARM_Dynamic_Sensory_Integration

This code can be used to run the Dynamic Task to examine multisensory integration in a dynamic (moving) context. In this task, participants are cued visually or proprioceptively (or in both modalities), and are asked to report the experienced movement. Feedback is given about report errors at the movement midpoint.

Participants experience 4 types of trials:
   -V trials: A movement is cued visually, and participants must reproduce the movement they observed using their hand
   -P trials: A movement is cued proprioceptively, and participants must reproduce the movement they observed using their hand
   -VPv trials: A movement is cued visually and proprioceptively (with V and P cues misaligned), and participants must report the V movement while ignoring the P movement
   -VPp trials: A movement is cued visually and proprioceptively (with V and P cues misaligned), and participants must report the P movement while ignoring the V movement
